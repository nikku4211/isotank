# Isotank
 A 3D renderer for the SNES' S-CPU.

## Dependencies
- [LibSFX](https://github.com/Optiroc/libSFX)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
    - [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/pillow/) is a requirement for `romusage.py` and `wavefront2mol.py`
        - If you're on MSYS2, install `mingw-w64-python-pillow` and run the MinGW-W64 MSYS2 console.
- [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
    - Binary builds for Windows x64 are provided, but if you use Linux and you don't feel like compiling the C code of the LUT generators, [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) is recommended.
- [SNESMOD](https://github.com/mukunda-/snesmod/tree/main/smconv)
    - Again, a binary build for SMConv for Windows x64 is provided, but if you are on Linux and don't want to compile Go code, use Wine to run the provided .exe.

## Building
For Windows users, [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) is recommended to build the engine.

Build LibSFX somewhere and change the path `libsfx_dir` in the `makefile` points to where your build of LibSFX is.

LibSFX is a SNES library with plenty of macros I personally find useful, and it even includes useful tools.
The LibSFX tools used by this project include:
- SuperFamiConv
- SuperFamiCheck

LibSFX also comes with CA65, which is a popular assembler for homebrew on multiple 65xx-based consoles, including the SNES.
This project uses it.

- If you're on MSYS2, install the `mingw-w64-x86_64-python` and `gcc` packages.

- If you're on Linux, build SNESMOD, then replace the path `SNESMOD` points to in the `makefile` to the path your build of SNESMOD SMConv is and replace `smconv.exe` with the Linux executeable. Also replace the `.exe` in the filenames of the LUT generators in the `makefile` with whatever executeable format your OS uses.

After all that, just run `make` in the command line. If you see some alignment warnings, that's normal, and the game will still build.

If you want to replace the model used in the demo, just put your model's `.obj` file (and `.mtl` file) in the `obj` subdirectory and replace the `.obj` file in the `makefile` with your own model's `.obj` file.
Also feel free to change the scale number at the end if the model vertex scaling isn't to your liking.
